# Weather Dashboard

I'm building a weather dashboard where users can enter a city name to get the current weather and receive an outfit suggestion based on the temperature and weather condition.

## Features

- Enter any city name to get current weather information
- Receive personalized outfit suggestions based on temperature and weather conditions
